# Pythoid

Pythoid is a Java mod for the game `Project Zomboid` that integrates the `Jython` Python 2.7.3 
interpreter to Java, enabling Python support for modding the game.

Pythoid ships utilities that aids in integration of Python-built classes with Lua's ability to both
see and invoke.

# Pythoid-Typings

Pythoid-Typings casts a large net, exposing Project Zomboid's Java environment for Python mods to see
what they can modify & use. It is not complete however all PZ-written classes are currently exposed.
Opportunities exist for writing a full-exposure of third-party libraries. This is an on-going project.

# Note:

Due to a recent update, Pylance no longer resolves imports with folders named the same as `.pyi` files
so downgrade your Pylance extension to version `2024.7.1` in order to use these typings. If you don't
know how to do this, go to your extensions tab on the left-side of the vscode window, look up `Pylance`,
and right-click it to install the correct version.
